For the Ghostfolio investment management platform, I conducted an in-depth penetration testing engagement, leveraging a combination of automated tools and manual techniques to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities within the platform's infrastructure. My testing approach began with OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) gathering, using tools like Shodan and Google Dorking to uncover publicly available information about the platform and its network. This initial reconnaissance allowed me to identify potential attack vectors and weak points within the network that could be exploited.

###

Next, I employed Burp Suite, a leading web application security testing tool, to assess the platform’s web applications. Through a series of controlled attacks, I was able to bypass authentication mechanisms, manipulate session tokens, and expose insecure API endpoints. Burp Suite's suite of tools, including the Intruder and Scanner features, enabled me to perform targeted attacks and automatically scan for vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and insecure HTTP methods. Additionally, I used Nmap and Wireshark to scan the network for open ports, map out the infrastructure, and capture network traffic, which helped me identify unencrypted data being transmitted over the network.

###

After successfully gaining access to the network, I took immediate action to secure the system. The first step was to perform a thorough analysis of the compromised areas and implement patch management to address known vulnerabilities. I enforced stronger authentication protocols, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), and ensured that all passwords and session tokens were hashed and encrypted using industry-standard algorithms like bcrypt. To protect against unauthorized access, I configured firewalls and implemented Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor and prevent malicious activity in real-time.

I also focused on improving the platform's data security by securing APIs and ensuring all sensitive information was encrypted both in transit and at rest. To further bolster the platform’s resilience, I conducted additional social engineering tests to assess human vulnerabilities and helped train the team on recognizing phishing attempts and other common threats.
###

Finally, I compiled a detailed report outlining all vulnerabilities found, the steps taken to exploit them, and the measures implemented to secure the network. This report included actionable recommendations for continuous monitoring and improvement of the platform’s security posture. Thanks to this thorough penetration testing and remediation process, the Ghostfolio platform’s network is now more robust, secure, and resilient against potential cyberattacks, ensuring the integrity and safety of user data.
