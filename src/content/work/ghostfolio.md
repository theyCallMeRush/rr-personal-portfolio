For <a href="https://ghostfol.io/en/home">Ghostfolio</a> I implemented an enterprise-level SEO strategy to enhance their investment management platform's visibility and performance. The project began with an in-depth SEO audit to identify technical and content gaps, followed by optimizing on-page elements such as meta tags, headers, and URL structures, all tailored to high-value, investment-related keywords. I used advanced keyword research tools like SEMrush and Ahrefs to pinpoint opportunities in a competitive market, targeting both broad and niche investment terms.

###

For off-page SEO, I developed a strategic backlink plan, focusing on acquiring authoritative financial and investment-related backlinks to improve Ghostfolio’s domain authority. I used outreach tools to build relationships with industry leaders and secure high-quality links from reputable financial websites.

###

On the technical side, I ensured the platform's scalability with robust SEO infrastructure, optimizing page load speeds, reducing server response times, and enhancing mobile performance for better user experience and ranking. I also implemented structured data (Schema.org) to improve visibility in rich search results and leveraged Google Tag Manager to track important conversion metrics and user behaviors.

###

Additionally, I set up Google Analytics to monitor key performance indicators, providing Ghostfolio with real-time insights into traffic, engagement, and conversions. This comprehensive SEO strategy led to improved search rankings, increased organic traffic, and greater user engagement for Ghostfolio’s investment management platform.
