For <a href="https://ghostfol.io/en/home">Ghostfolio</a> I developed the platform using NestJS, leveraging its modular architecture to create a robust, scalable solution for tracking and managing investment portfolios. The project began with a detailed analysis of user requirements, which informed the creation of key modules: a User Module for authentication and profile management, a Portfolio Module for tracking and analyzing investments, and an Integration Module to connect with third-party financial data providers. For secure and efficient user authentication, I implemented JWT for stateless sessions, OAuth2 for social logins, and role-based access control (RBAC) to define user permissions. The backend used TypeORM to manage dynamic database schemas, enabling seamless handling of user transactions and real-time portfolio metrics. I integrated third-party APIs for live market data, using NestJS's HTTP module and Redis caching to ensure fast and reliable updates.

Data security was a top priority, with encryption using bcrypt for passwords and AES algorithms for sensitive information, alongside strict input validation through class-validator. I also implemented robust logging and analytics with Winston and the ELK stack, capturing system performance and user interactions to support business insights. Deployment was handled via Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes, while CI/CD pipelines built with GitHub Actions streamlined testing and deployment to AWS infrastructure. By focusing on both functionality and security, I delivered a modern, scalable platform that empowers users to track and optimize their investments with confidence.
