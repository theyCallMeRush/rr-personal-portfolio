For <a href="https://www.jasper.ai/use-cases/seo?fpr=rushlow-media&fp_sid=seo">Jasper AI</a>, I developed and implemented a comprehensive SEO and PPC strategy that combined advanced technical SEO, Google Ads optimization, and custom web scraping tools to generate high-quality leads. I began by building a Python-based web scraper using BeautifulSoup and Scrapy to extract valuable business contact details, specifically targeting marketing agencies in key regions. The scraper was fine-tuned for speed and precision, ensuring the collection of verified, high-conversion leads. This data was then integrated into a robust Google Ads campaign, where I targeted highly relevant keywords, optimized bids, and employed dynamic search ads to reach the most relevant audience.

In parallel, I crafted and implemented a PPC strategy that maximized Google Ads’ potential through advanced features like audience targeting, remarketing, and custom ad creatives. By leveraging demographic and behavioral targeting, I was able to capture high-intent users and drive them to the website with highly relevant ads. Through constant optimization, including A/B testing of ad copy, landing pages, and bidding strategies, I ensured a significant increase in ROI and a steady flow of qualified traffic.
##
I also incorporated keyword forecasting to anticipate search trends and optimize keyword targeting across both organic and paid channels. By analyzing historical data and using tools like SEMrush and Google Trends, I was able to forecast high-potential keywords and identify seasonal fluctuations in search behavior. This allowed me to proactively adjust bidding strategies in Google Ads and tailor content creation to align with emerging search trends, ensuring Gizmogo captured maximum visibility at the right time. The ability to predict and act on keyword trends played a key role in driving sustained traffic and improving both paid ad performance and organic search rankings.
##
To support these efforts, I also designed automated email flows using Mailchimp and HubSpot, leveraging the scraped lead data. These emails were tailored to the agency’s size and regional location, ensuring relevance and engagement. Using A/B testing, I optimized subject lines, copy, and CTAs, achieving higher open rates and conversion rates.
##
As a result of this integrated approach, Jasper’s conversion rate increased by 18% over six months. The combination of Google Ads optimization, technical SEO, lead generation via web scraping, and personalized email marketing resulted in measurable growth, with high-quality traffic and an efficient sales funnel that drove sustained customer acquisition.
