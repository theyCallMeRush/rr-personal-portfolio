For <a href="https://Gizmogo.com">Gizmogo</a> I elevated their SEO performance and lead generation by implementing a deeply technical, data-driven approach, leveraging my expertise in Technical SEO, custom Python scrapers, and advanced optimization strategies. At the core of this strategy, I developed and deployed custom Python scrapers to extract high-value data from competitors' websites, including keywords, backlink profiles, and traffic patterns. These scrapers automated the gathering of essential market insights and competitor performance metrics, feeding directly into Gizmogo’s SEO strategy and providing an edge in identifying untapped opportunities and high-conversion keywords.

To drive significant improvements in Gizmogo’s search rankings, I implemented an exhaustive technical SEO audit, addressing critical areas such as site architecture, crawl efficiency, page load speed, and mobile optimization. I ensured that Gizmogo's website adhered to the best practices outlined by Google’s Core Web Vitals, improving page speed and user experience across all devices. I also executed comprehensive on-page SEO optimizations, focusing on keyword-rich meta tags, optimized internal linking structures, and strategic content placement to enhance relevancy and boost organic rankings for high-value search terms.

To further strengthen Gizmogo’s backlink profile, I executed a robust outreach campaign that targeted authoritative domains and secured high-quality, relevant backlinks. I utilized tools such as Ahrefs and Moz to track backlink health, identify link-building opportunities, and continuously monitor the site’s backlink strategy, improving domain authority and trustworthiness in Google's eyes.

Additionally, I implemented advanced analytics and monitoring using Google Search Console and custom reporting dashboards to track performance, diagnose issues, and make real-time adjustments to the SEO strategy. Regular A/B testing on page elements, keyword targeting, and content strategies were integral in refining our approach and ensuring long-term success. This combination of highly technical, strategic SEO management led to improved organic traffic, higher search visibility, and a sustainable, scalable growth trajectory for Gizmogo’s buyback and recycling services.
