For <a href="https://Gizmogo.com">Gizmogo</a> I boosted conversions by 29% in just 4 months by leveraging a combination of cold emailing, Google Ads, and Meta Ads. By strategically implementing cold email campaigns, I targeted high-potential leads, nurturing them into conversions with automated follow-ups and personalized messaging. I optimized Google Ads to maximize visibility for key search terms and drive qualified traffic to the site, while continuously refining ad targeting and bid strategies to improve ROI. Additionally, I utilized Meta Ads to reach a broader audience and drive engagement through precise targeting, leveraging dynamic creatives and split testing to refine performance.

This multi-channel approach, backed by constant optimization and a focus on data-driven results, led to a significant increase in conversions while ensuring sustainable growth for Gizmogoâ€™s buyback and recycling services. By aligning the right messaging with the right audience at every touchpoint, I successfully accelerated their digital marketing efforts and delivered measurable results.
