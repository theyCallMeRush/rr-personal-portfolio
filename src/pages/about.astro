					<p>
						With over 10 years of experience in web development, cybersecurity, and digital strategy, I have developed a diverse skill set that enables me to offer comprehensive solutions across a wide range of digital needs. My expertise in Next.js, TailwindCSS, PHP, WordPress, and Shopify allows me to create dynamic, high-performance, and SEO-optimized websites and web applications that not only meet, but exceed, my clients’ expectations. I specialize in building custom, scalable solutions that drive results, whether for a corporate website, a personal blog, or a high-traffic e-commerce store. In addition to my development expertise, I have a strong background in cybersecurity, focusing on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), penetration testing, and ethical hacking. As businesses become more reliant on digital platforms, ensuring the security of your online presence is crucial. I specialize in identifying vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them, using ethical hacking techniques to assess your site’s security and implement best practices to protect your data. Whether it’s testing for vulnerabilities in web applications, networks, or systems, I provide comprehensive security audits and actionable remediation steps. Tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and Metasploit are central to my penetration testing process, allowing me to simulate real-world attacks and provide clients with detailed reports on how to patch security holes.

Whether it’s optimizing a WordPress site, securing an e-commerce platform, or building a custom web application, my focus is always on delivering high-quality, results-driven solutions that will help you achieve your business objectives.

 						In today’s competitive digital landscape, having a website that is fast, secure, and user-friendly is non-negotiable. That’s why I go beyond just development and offer a comprehensive suite of services that include security audits, SEO optimization, and ongoing support to ensure your website remains robust, scalable, and optimized for both performance and search engines.
